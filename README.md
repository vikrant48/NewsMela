## Note: API Fetching Issues after Deployment

Due to an issue with fetching data from the News API after deployment (such as CORS errors, API key restrictions, or server configuration problems), the live version of this project might not display the news articles as expected. 

To give you an idea of how the website looks and functions, I've provided a screenshot of the working local version of the site below:
